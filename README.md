# The DISSTANS Python package

Welcome to the package repository for the **D**ecomposition and **I**nference of
**S**ources through **S**patio**t**emporal **A**nalysis of **N**etwork **S**ignals
(DISSTANS) toolbox.

With DISSTANS, you can:

- Fit GNSS displacement (or any type of) timeseries using a variety of functional
  models. These range from common ones such as a polynomial, a sinusoid, or a
  logarithm, to more complex ones as modulated sinusoids or dictionary of
  splines.
- Solve for model parameters using least squares with no regularization or using
  any of the L2, L1, and L0 norms. Spatial L0 allows to use expected spatial coherence
  in the data to improve local fits.
- Take advantage of multiprocessor systems using multiple threads for the most
  computationally heavy steps.
- Perform PCA/ICA-based common mode estimation and timeseries basis decomposition.
- Clean data from outliers.
- Visualize timeseries, network maps, dictionary scalograms, station motions,
  model parameter correlations, and more.
- Manage databases of raw RINEX files, including availability plots.
- Download GNSS timeseries from public sites.
- Use catalogued seismic and maintenance events to inform the model setup.
- Detect jumps in the data using a simple step detector.
- Run the [MIDAS](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JB012552) algorithm.
- Generate synthetic timeseries.
- Load timeseries in JPL's `.tseries` or UNR's `.tenv3` formats natively,
  or load standard NumPy and pandas data.

All from within your Python shell, and everything in standard Python object-oriented
programming style, allowing you to easily subclass existing code to suit your individual
needs.

## Documentation

A peer-reviewed study is currently in the works (see _Using and citing this work_ below)
that explains the concept, inner workings, goals, and successes of DISSTANS in detail.
You can find the preprint here:
[Decomposition and Inference of Sources through Spatiotemporal Analysis of Network
Signals: The DISSTANS Python Package](https://doi.org/10.31223/X56K9J).

Furthermore, DISSTANS contains full code annotation, an API documentation, as well as
tutorials and real-data examples that show the usage of the package.

The documentation can be found in the `docs/` folder. It is hosted on GitHub publicly
at [tobiscode.github.io/disstans](https://tobiscode.github.io/disstans), but you can
also read it locally, e.g., by running `python -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1`
from with the documentation folder and then opening a browser.

## Installation

The full installation instructions, including necessary prerequisites, can be found
[in the documentation](https://tobiscode.github.io/disstans/installation.html).

If you're happy with a minimal installation (no local documentation, not suited for
modifications, without experimental newest commits), then the short answer is:

``` bash
# download the environment file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobiscode/disstans/main/environment.yml
# create the environment, including all prerequisites
conda env create -f environment.yml
# activate the environment
conda activate disstans
# install DISSTANS from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
pip install disstans
```

Updating the code is then just:

``` bash
pip install --upgrade disstans
```
